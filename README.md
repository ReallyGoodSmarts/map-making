# Map Making

Tools and data for making maps for other projects.

See `scripts/` for map-making scripts.

National data generally downloaded from the [US Census cartographic site](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html).

Copies are stored in `original-geos/` and temporarily deflated into `tmp/`.
